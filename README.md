# chatapp
My chat app using Springboot, HTML/CSS/JS

To get the app:
gh repo clone papio2312/chatapp
Or download it from a .zip file and extract it.

After that, open your IDE (VS code, Intellij IDEA etc.). 

To open the app go to src/test/java/com/example/chat/ChatApplication.java and then Run it from the Run command.
